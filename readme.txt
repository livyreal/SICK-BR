This is the repository of SICK-BR, a Portuguese inference corpus, aligned to and translated from SICK (Marelli et al., 2014).
To know more about the resource, please see the paper: Real, Livy; Rodrigues, Ana; Vieira e Silva, Andressa; Albiero, Beatriz; Thalenberg, Bruna; Guide, Bruno; Silva, Cindy; Oliveira Lima, Guilherme de, Camara, Igor C.

PROPOR2018 (International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese), 26 September 2018. Canela, Brazil.

Part of the SICK-BR will be used in ASSIN 2, a shared task of inference and semantic similarity to be held in Salvador (BA/Brazil), in October 2019, in conjuction with STIL 2019.
SICK-BR will be available here after the ASSIN 2 shared task.
